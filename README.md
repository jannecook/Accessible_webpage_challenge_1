# Accessible Webpage Challenge 1

## Description

This project consisted of updating the code of a webpage for a marketing company. The updated code was intended to be more accessible for persons with disabilities. The updated code was also intended to be more functional and streamlined. These changes were intended to address the prior lack of accessibility and repetitive code. I learned about implementing changes to existing HTML and CSS files.
